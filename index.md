## Welcome to Motaz's Teaching Page

Here you will find all the materials I have created for my teaching assignments. I don't generally correct notes after the semester is over, so you will likely find typos/thinkos, but I hope they can still be useful!

### PhD Micro I

These notes are from the fall semester of PhD Micro. I created them as the TA for Professor Chiappori (Part 1) and Professor Salanié (Part 2) in Fall 2017.

### Intermediate Micro

I have taught Intermediate Micro a number of times. I created these notes in Fall 2018 when TAing for Professor Ingmar Nyman, based partially on hand-written notes from Spring 2018. I partially re-used these notes in Spring 2020, with some additional material created for exam reviews.
