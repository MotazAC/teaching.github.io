## Welcome to Motaz's Teaching Page

Here you will find all the materials I have created for my teaching assignments. I don't generally correct notes after the semester is over, so you will likely find typos/thinkos, but I hope they can still be useful!

### PhD Micro I

These notes are from the fall semester of PhD Micro. I created them as the TA for Professor Chiappori (Part 1) and Professor Salanié (Part 2) in Fall 2018.

1. [1.1 - Intro to Consumer Theory](https://motazac.github.io/teaching.github.io/PhD%20Micro%20I/1.1%20-%20Intro%20to%20Consumer%20Theory.pdf)
